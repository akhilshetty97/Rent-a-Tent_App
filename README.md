'Rent A Tent' attempts to provide rental houses via app. Users have an option to rent an
apartment or put it up on rent.
The user will first have to create an accountÂ on the app. After log in, user can find a rental
home of choice across Mumbai from the list of uploaded houses. In case a user wants to put
up his house on rent, he will put up the details of his house along with its location and
